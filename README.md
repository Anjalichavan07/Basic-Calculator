Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
Square Root: Calculate the square root of a number.
Percentage: Calculate percentage of a number.
Memory Functions:
M+: Add the current input value to memory.
MR: Recall the value stored in memory.
MC: Clear the memory.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the calculator.
CSS: Styling and layout of the calculator.
JavaScript: Handling user input, calculations, and memory functions.
How to Use
Basic Operations:
